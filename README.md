# Hello, I'm Muhammad Arham Arsyad 👋

Welcome to my **Cyber Security** journey! 🚀

As a **beginner in cybersecurity**, I'm passionate about learning the ins and outs of ethical hacking, penetration testing, and system security. This repository is where I'll be documenting my progress, sharing what I’ve learned, and showcasing small projects as I continue to grow my skills in the field.

## My Goals in Cyber Security
- 🌱 **Learn the fundamentals** of cybersecurity.
- 🔍 **Understand different attack vectors** such as network attacks, Binary Exploitation, and web vulnerabilities.
- 🛡️ **Practice ethical hacking** by using tools like Kali Linux, Wireshark, Nmap, and more.
- 🏆 **Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions** to challenge myself.
- 📚 **Develop skills** in secure coding practices and vulnerability assessments.
  
## Tools and Technologies I'm Exploring
- Kali Linux 🐧
- Wireshark 🐬
- Nmap 🛰️
- Metasploit 🧑‍💻
- Burp Suite 🕵️‍♂️
- GDB 🔐

## Why Cyber Security?
The field of cybersecurity fascinates me because it's like solving a puzzle—each vulnerability is a piece waiting to be discovered. The need to **protect systems and data** in an ever-evolving digital world is a challenge I’m eager to take on!

## My Learning Plan
1. **Participate in CTF challenges** to test my knowledge in a real-world setting.
2. **Learn about different types of malware** and how to defend against them.
3. **Master ethical hacking tools** for vulnerability scanning and network monitoring.

Stay tuned as I dive deeper into this exciting field and feel free to join me on this journey!
